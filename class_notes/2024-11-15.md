## 1. Plan

Tonight we will discuss unsupervised learning in general and then use the k-mean clustering algorithm to analyze housing data. K-means is based on the concepts of feature space and distance that we introduced last time - a quick review might be useful!

## 2. Unsupervised learning

Unsupervised learning is a branch of machine learning that comprises problems where there are no labels - i.e. we are not trying to predict the value of a specific output variable. Most unsupervised machine learning techniques can be separated into two classes.

1. **Clustering**: Grouping data together without specifying ahead of time exactly what the groups are or what data belongs to which group.
2. **Dimensionality reduction**: reducing the number of features in a dataset.

## 3. Tonight's project

In tonight's project we will first use K-means (an unsupervised machine learning technique) to cluster data. Then, we will train a classifier to predict the cluster that new data should belong to (a supervised machine learning technique). The work-flow is a little different that the other project so far because there are two different model training steps.

Take a look at the [MVP notebook](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/gperdrizet-k-means-project/blob/main/src/mvp.ipynb) for my suggestions for how to set it up. Here is a shorter outline as well:

1. Load the data
2. EDA/feature engineering
3. Unsupervised model training
4. More EDA/feature engineering on the new data from the unsupervised model
5. Supervised model training
6. Model evaluation
