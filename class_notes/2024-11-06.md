## 1. Plan

Tonight we will introduce the last tree-based algorithm: the gradient boosting decision tree classifier. Since this is the last project that involves the diabetes dataset, we will also take a step back and look at EDA.

## 2. Exploratory data analysis

Exploratory data analysis and the resulting feature engineering is often the most time consuming and complex part of a data science project. Good EDA also will usually result in a much better model than any amount of hyperparameter tuning.

In an effort to help folks think about EDA effectively, I have added summary of EDA with some 'thought experiment' type examples to this repo. We will discuss the document in class, but give it a read here:

## 3. Data science project notebook guidelines

Since the EDA guidelines are little long-winded and vague (or philosophical and theoretical...), I am also adding some specific guidelines on what should be in a 'good' data science project submission:
