# 2024-10-30: Wednesday, week 9

## 1. Plan

Plan for today is to continue catch-up work and introduce some new collaboration tools and methods. We will split into three teams and each team will work on one of the three most recent projects. We will complete the work in phases and share with the group at the end of each phase. Here are the teams and the projects:

## 2. Teams

### Team 1: Logistic Regression Project Tutorial

- Trevor Kortum
- Aaron Matthews
- Chris Lucas
- Cheick Diallo

### Team 2: Regularized Linear Regression Project Tutorial

- Kelsey Low
- Jasmine LaRose (late add)
- Gabriel Burton
- Les Desrameaux

### Team 3: Linear Regression Project Tutorial

- Maria Rodrigues
- Mahamadou Mahi Diallo
- Akash Alamuthu
- Aaron Jordan

## 3. Instructions

If you look at each of the three projects, they all have similar steps:

1. Load the data/EDA
2. Build a model
3. Optimize improve the model

Each team will work together in a breakout room on phase 1 of their project. After 30 minutes, we will reconvene in the lobby and each group will share their solution (quick, less than 5 minute overview of rationale and steps). Then the same for phase 2 and phase 3.

Focus on creating the most basic possible solution that works. In the engineering world this is called a MVP or minium viable product. It's meant to be a starting point to iterate from. You don't want to get bogged down and spend forever on EDA only to realize later during optimization that you should have done it differently. The goal it get it working end-to-end quickly and then go back and improve. Make mistakes early and often.

At the end of the night you all will have a solution to your group's project and a solid understanding of/start on the other two.

## 4. Collaboration

The first person listed in each group will be the 'server' - meaning they will fork the project repository, start a codespace and [live share it](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/gperdrizet-ds7-materials/blob/main/how_to/vscode_live_share.md) to the other members. This way everyone can work together on the same solution. At the end of class you can each then fork the server's repository from each team to finish and submit your own solutions to all three project.

## 4. The competition

To encourage you to improve upon the basic solution assembled in class, I will ask everyone to star the best individual solution on GitHub during the next class. Exactly what 'best' means will depend on the project, but generally think best accuracy, lowest error, etc. But it could also be most clever, most efficient or something else.
