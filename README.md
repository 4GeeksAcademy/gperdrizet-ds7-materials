## 12/16 Update

- This Friday (20th) last meeting before break. Next class after that will be Monday Jan. 6th.
- Wednesday (18th) finalize project groups and final topics.
- Friday (20th) GitHub set-up for dev tooling/data wrangling and collaboration.

## 12/09 Update

Tonight marks the launch of the final project. I know many of you still have some catching up to do, so you will need to start splitting your time. Luckily, we need to choose topics first, so you have a few days until the heavy coding work begins.

The first goal is to choose a topic/problem/question and identify a data source. To that end, I have set up a Google doc for each group with a template for project ideas. Plan to contribute at least one idea by Friday, we will workshop the ideas together and select the best one.

The short overview of the final project is as follows:

1. We will split the class into two groups, each will work collaboratively on a single final project.
2. The topic can be anything that uses data science and results in deployable/usable/functioning final product.
3. The topic is up to you and your group to decide.
4. We will spend the next 7 weeks working on the project together.
5. On the last day, you will present your project to the 4Geeks community (invite your family and friends!).

The project will be documented on the 4Geeks site and is a great showpiece for your portfolio. The final project is an opportunity to push your data and engineering skills and show of what you have learned to prospective employers.

## 12/04 Update

As discussed in class last night, here is the plan for the end of this week and into the next. With a view toward getting started on the final project, Friday will be a catchup day in class. Before then, try to spend at least one hour on each of the following projects, if you have not completed them already:

1. Decision trees
2. K nearest neighbors
3. Introduction to deep learning
4. ML web app with Flask

That means two hours today and two hours tomorrow. If you can't fit it in, don't worry about it too much - do what you can. Be sure you have at least forked the repo and loaded the data for each project.

Then, in class Friday we can address any technical issues that crop up or theoretical questions you might have. The idea being that everyone will have these four projects completed by the time Monday rolls around.

If you have already completed these projects and are all caught up you should either: go over your project repos and give them a polish. Replace the boilerplate README, write comments, fix typos, add a good outline, make sure plots have axis labels, etc. Remember: these projects are the start of your data science portfolio - they should look good! Or, you could start brainstorming problems/topics for the final project and researching data sources. See the [finding data science problems page](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/gperdrizet-ds7-materials/blob/main/how_to/find_data_science_problems.md) for some resources.

For folks working to catch up on projects (and everyone else too!) a few pieces of advice as you learn to be more efficient and get things across the finish line:

1. Each project in the course should not take longer than 4 or maybe 5 hours total. Many of them should take significantly less than that.
2. Follow the project skeleton laid out for you in the MVP notebook.
3. Don't try to reproduce the solution. My solutions are the 'fancy' version - they are meant for inspiration/reference, to illustrate more advanced concepts and to show you what is possible.
4. Go over the whole project end to end first. Read the skeleton and make sure you understand what to do and why, you can figure out how later.
5. As you mentally work through the steps of the project, write notes or pseudocode to organize how you will accomplish each step.
6. Each part of a project does not have to be perfect before you move on, if you spend hours stuck on a single function, you may not even be aware of something you would have wanted to ask a question about later in the project.
