# Data Science 7 Course Materials

Collection of notes, documentation and instructor solutions for Data Science 7, fall 2024.

## 12/04 Update

As discussed in class last night here is the plan for the end of this week and into the next with a view toward getting started on the final project. Friday will be a catchup day in class Before then, spend at least one hour on each of the following projects, if you have not completed them already:

1. Decision trees
2. K nearest neighbors
3. Introduction to deep learning
4. ML web app with Flask

That means two hours today and two hours tomorrow. We will then If you can't fit it in, don't worry about it too much - do what you can. Be sure you have at least forked the repo and loaded the data for each project.

Then, in class Friday we can address any technical issues that crop up or theoretical questions you might have. The idea being that everyone will have these four projects completed by the time Monday rolls around.

If you have already completed these projects and are all caught up you should either: go back over all of your project repos and give them a polish. Replace the boilerplate README, write comments, fix typos, add a good outline, make sure plots have axis labels, etc. Remember: these projects are the start of your data science portfolio - they should look good! Or, you could start brainstorming problems/topics for the final project and researching data sources. See the [finding data science problems page]() for some resources.

For folks working to catch up on project (and everyone else too!) a few pieces of advice as you learn to be more efficient and get things across the finish line:

1. Each project in the course should not take longer than 4 or maybe 5 hours total. Many of them should be significantly less than that.
2. Follow the project skeleton laid out for you in the MVP notebook.
3. Don't try to reproduce the solution. My solutions are the 'fancy' version - they are meant for inspiration/reference, to illustrate more advanced concepts and to show you what is possible.
4. Go over the whole project end to end first. Read the skeleton and make sure you understand what to do and why, you can figure out how later.
5. As you mentally work through the steps of the project, write notes or pseudocode to organize how you will accomplish each step.
6. Each part of a project does not have to be perfect before you move on, if you spend and hour stuck on a single function, you may not even be aware of something you would have wanted to ask a question about later in the project.
