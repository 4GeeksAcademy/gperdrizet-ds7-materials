# Repository links

## 1. MVPs

**MVP** stands for 'minimum viable product'. These repos represent the absolute simplest, most minimal solution that I could come up with. They are meant to be a starting point only, to get you up and running fast so that you can iterate and experiment with the concepts covered in class. I don't guarantee that they are 'good' or even 'right', only that the code runs without error and produces the desired type of output.

2. [Random forest MVP](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/gperdrizet-random-forest-project/blob/main/src/mvp.ipynb)
3. [Naive bayes MVP](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/gperdrizet-naive-bayes-project/blob/main/src/mvp.ipynb)
4. [k-nearest neighbors](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/gperdrizet-K-nearest-neighbors-project/blob/main/src/mvp.ipynb)

## 2. Instructor solutions

Solutions will be uploaded after we have worked on the project in class - they are not meant to be a code copy-paste bank for you to harvest. Instead, use them to check your thinking and implementation and make improvements to your code.
